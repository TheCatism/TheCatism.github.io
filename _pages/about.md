Hi and welcome to my blog. I am a cyber security enthusiast and I like to learn about vulnerabilities, malware, and programming. I'll mainly be posting about those topics and whatever else I'm working on at the moment like a hack the box machine or a CTF challenge.

Feel free to follow me on Twitter or add me on LinkedIn.
