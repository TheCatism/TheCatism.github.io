Hi and welcome to my blog. I am a cyber security enthusiast and I like to learn about reverse engineering and vulnerability research. I'll mainly be posting about those topics and whatever else I'm working on at the moment like a CTF challenge.

Feel free to follow me on Twitter or add me on Discord.
